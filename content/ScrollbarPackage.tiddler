<pre>This package allows you to set fixed or percentage heights with scrollbars (as needed) for various page elements.  You can also set the number of //flowed columns// of tiddlers to show in the story area (FireFox only), and whether the sidebars scroll with the page content (default) or remain fixed in position as the rest of the page content is scrolled.  In addition, the [[ScrollBox]] tiddler allows you to display a specified tiddler in a fixed-height scrolling area embedded within another tiddler.</pre>
