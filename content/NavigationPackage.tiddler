<pre>These plugins help make it easier to navigate within a TiddlyWiki document.  They provide several different ways to interact with your document to search, explore, and display specific tiddlers of interest and then rearrange/fold those tiddlers, save/restore 'stories' (lists of displayed tiddlers), or quickly back-track to previously viewed tiddlers, even after closing them!</pre>
