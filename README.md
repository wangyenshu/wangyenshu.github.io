TiddlyWiki
==========

This is the master repository of the Classic version (2.x.x) of TiddlyWiki (not to be confused with [TiddlyWiki5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5), which is rewritten from scratch and backward incompatible with Classic).

If you simply wish to use TiddlyWiki or to find out more about it, it is easiest to do so at [classic.tiddlywiki.com](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com). Also, you can get help in the [TiddlyWikiClassic group](https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywikiclassic). If you have some feedback, you can use both the google group and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki/issues).

TiddlyWiki's source code is split up into a number of separate files which are then joined together by the `npm run build-core` command (requires Node.js and NPM to be installed) to produce a single HTML file. See scripts and instructions for testing and building TiddlyWiki and docs for tiddlywiki.com in the [build/README.md](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki/blob/dev/build/README.md) file.

Discussion on TiddlyWiki development takes place on GitHub and on the TiddlyWikiClassic group; the [old TiddlyWikiDev group](http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWikiDev) my be useful to discuss issue related to both TWC and TW5.
